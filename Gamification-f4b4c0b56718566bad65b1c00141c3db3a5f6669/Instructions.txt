Incase you get stuck: 
The game starts with a selection screen where the only possible kingdom to chose is the desert.
Once the desert is chosen you can click on the pyramids to bring you to a walking scene.
The walking scene lasts two minutes and at the end you can click the telescope to bring you to space.
In space you can click the particles to present a selection of stars where the player can draw their own constellation
We then have a basic mockup of the meditation scene where the project ends.
THanks :)
